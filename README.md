## Inspiration
Can't pay attention to class? Wish there was an easier way to catch up? We've all been there. As students, we understand how difficult it is to grasp content, take notes, or even stay focused in long lectures. You zone out for 2 minutes and you miss a whole unit. 

## What it does
"SLack Off" doesn't just summarize lectures; it revolutionizes your learning journey with a personalized touch. Unlike other AI lecture notetakers, it doesn't just regurgitate information â€“ it provides you personalized study plans, summaries of powerpoints and lecture audio, and generates relevant practice problems based on your class material -- so you don't have to zone out or be confused in class again. Instead, you can take learning into your own hands with the guidance of a companion -- allowing you to "slack off" without sacrificing learning! 

Features: 

**1. Efficiency Meets Effectiveness:**
Experience education tailored to your needs. SLack OFF doesn't simply hand you reports and answers; it breaks down your specific lecture content into an easily readable summary to make learning more digestible. Plus, you can learn at your own pace -- fast-forwarding through the comfortable stuff. 

**2.. True Relevance Unlike Other AI Generators:**
We go beyond generic summaries. Instead, our AI identifies keywords from your uploaded content to highlight important concepts and definitions. Additionally, it tailors your practice to hands-on problems or more conceptual questions, depending on whether the subject is more STEM-related or humanities-related. 

**3. Personalized Study Plans:**
We're not just another AI tool; we're your intelligent study companion, ensuring that your study sessions are not just productive but genuinely impactful. Effective learning starts with active recall, so we start with a relevant summary, followed by explanations highlighting key concepts and definitions, and finally, personalized practice to apply your knowledge. Identify your strengths, address your weaknesses, and optimize your study time efficiently. 

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, Typescript, and React for the frontend, designed/prototyped with Figma first. 
In the backend, we used Python Flask, and Cohere and OpenAI APIs.
